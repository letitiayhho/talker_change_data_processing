**Compute distance score**

```{r}
# Compute pairwise distances
coordinates <- get_coordinates()
distances <- get_pairwise_distances(coordinates)
distances_hist <- get_histogram_of_pairwise_distances(distances, title = "Histogram of pairwise distances")
ggsave(distances_hist, filename = 'threshold_free_clustering/figs/distances.png', width = 8, height = 6)

# Get distance score by standardizing then taking the inverse of the distance
distance_scores <- get_distance_score(distances)
inverse_distances_hist <- get_histogram_of_pairwise_distances(distance_scores, title = "Histogram of inverse and normalized pairwise distances")
ggsave(inverse_distances_hist, filename = 'threshold_free_clustering/figs/inverse_normed_distances.png', width = 8, height = 6)
```

**Compute weight**
```{r}
# # sd across all conditions (uh oh, I think we might want to go with this)... 
# # maybe I can't reweight the scores at all
# # but I can scale them, or maybe just standardize them??????
# overall_sd <- sd(c(S_w$w, T_w$w, M_w$w, N_w$w, L_w$w, H_w$w))
# 
# S_weight_scores <- sigmoid(S_w$w, spread = overall_sd, shift = 0.5)
# S_hist <- histogram(S_weight_scores, title = "S", xlim = c(0.5, 1.5))
# T_weight_scores <- sigmoid(T_w$w, spread = overall_sd, shift = 0.5)
# T_hist <- histogram(T_weight_scores, title = "T", xlim = c(0.5, 1.5))
