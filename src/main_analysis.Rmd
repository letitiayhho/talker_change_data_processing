#### 1. Do cortical regions track temporal variation in the speech signal?

``` {r}
# One-sample t-test for the cross-correlation values for each channel
t_xcorr <- get_one_sample_t(select(xcorr, all_of(channel_columns)))
get_frequency_table(t_xcorr, title = "Table 1. Channels significantly tracking the stimuli")
```

**Output 1. Channels with significant cross-correlation with stimulus waveform ($\alpha$ < 0.1)** Computed with a one-sample t-test for the cross-correlation of each stimulus waveform with each electrode EEG trace across all conditions.

```{r}
# Printing the t-test results for significant electrodes
t_xcorr[which(t_xcorr$p < 0.1),]
```




************

#### 2. Do cortical regions track differently depending on the conditions?

Tested by one-sample t-tests for significant waveform tracking in each level of each condition.

**Table 2. Channels significantly tracking the stimuli in the talker condition ($\alpha$ < 0.1)** 

```{r}
# One-sample t-tests over each electrode for the same talker condition
t_talker_s <- get_one_sample_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "talker", level = "S"))
t_talker_t <- get_one_sample_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "talker", level = "T"))
table <- get_combined_frequency_table(t_talker_s, t_talker_t)
add_header_above(table, c(" ", "Same talker" = 2, "Different talker" = 2))
```

**Table 3. Channels significantly tracking the stimuli in the meaning condition ($\alpha$ < 0.1)** 

```{r}
# One-sample t-tests over each electrode for the meaning condition
t_meaning_m <- get_one_sample_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "meaning", level = "M"))
t_meaning_n <- get_one_sample_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "meaning", level = "N"))
table <- get_combined_frequency_table(t_meaning_m, t_meaning_n)
add_header_above(table, c(" ", "Meaningful" = 2, "Nonsense" = 2))
```

**Table 4. Channels significantly tracking the stimuli in the constraint condition ($\alpha$ < 0.1)** 

```{r}
# One-sample t-tests over each electrode for the high constraint condition
t_constraint_s <- get_one_sample_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "constraint", level = "S"))
t_constraint_g <- get_one_sample_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "constraint", level = "G"))
table <- get_combined_frequency_table(t_constraint_s, t_constraint_g)
add_header_above(table, c(" ", "High constraint" = 2, "Low constraint" = 2))
```

#### 3. Do cortical regions track the levels of each condition differently?

Tested by paired-samples t-tests between the two levels of each condition. I.e. a test of whether an electrode significantly distinguishes condition levels.

**Channels significantly distinguishing the stimuli in each condition ($\alpha$ < 0.1)** 

```{r}
# Paired t-tests for talker
t_talker_paired <- get_paired_samples_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "talker", level = "S"),
                                              subset(xcorr, condition = "talker", level = "T"))
get_frequency_table(t_talker_paired, title = "Table 8. Talker")

# Paired t-tests for meaning
t_meaning_paired <- get_paired_samples_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "meaning", level = "M"),
                                               subset(xcorr, condition = "meaning", level = "N"))
get_frequency_table(t_meaning_paired, title = "Table 9. Meaning")

# Paired t-tests for constraint
t_constraint_paired <- get_paired_samples_t(subset(xcorr, condition = "constraint", level = "S"),
                                                  subset(xcorr, condition = "constraint", level = "G"))
get_frequency_table(t_constraint_paired, title = "Table 10. Constraint")
```


**Table 11. *p*-values for each level in each condition ($\alpha$ < 0.1, )**

**Table 12. Channels that distinguish between levels in a condition ($\alpha$ < 0.1)** The *condition diff* column contains channels that significantly distinguish between the two levels in a condition. The *match x* columns for individual levels indicate channels that significantly track the stimuli in the condition level. The *match both* column indicates channels that both distinguish between levels and significantly track stimuli under both levels. Differences between the *match x* columns in each condition show differences between the networks tracking speech under each condition level.
