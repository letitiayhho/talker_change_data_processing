Whether the role of attention is studied with regards to working memory capacity or language comprehension, the feature of interest is often how attention moves between features in space. In other words, most studies are concerned with the location and order of attentional focus. While a crucial feature of attention is its spatial distribution, few researchers have probed the temporal distribution of attention. Key properties of the temporal distribution of attention include the rhythm of attentional shifts and how attention tracks information that unfolds over time. In particular, this study is interested in the cognitive processes this tracking reflects. On a higher level, indicated mostly by timing, this tracking could indicate either prediction or a stimulus evoked response. At a lower level, differences in tracking across brain regions might reveal the cognitive processes underlying tracking such as the role of top-down signals in prediction. Both speech and music contain periodic signals that are presented serially in time and are thus ideal stimuli for the study of tracking. Different stimuli features of speech stimuli may be manipulated to make the signal more or less predictable on different levels. As such, the present study uses data from a study by Uddin et al. (2018), which manipulates the meaning of the final word and the semantic constraint of the sentence stem to make the final word more or less predictable on a semantic level while also varying the identity of the speaker to alter the predictability of the signal's acoustic properties.

To investigate the tracking of temporal properties this study will look at the eeg data collected while participants were presented with various sentence stimuli. There is evidence to suggest that alpha oscillations are associated with attention selection and control (Mathewson et al., 2011) and may even reflect temporal prediction (Rohenkohl & Nobre, 2011; Samaha et al., 2015). Obleser and Kayser (2019) propose that the phase of alpha and theta oscillations reflect changes in neural sensitivity to periodic stimulus features. Both theta and gamma oscillations have also been associated with attentional engagement with the stimuli (e.g. Giraud & Poeppel, 2012) and speech comprehension (Doelling et al., 2014; Peelle & Davis, 2012). In contrast to these perspectives, some have suggested that the similarity in temporal properties between eeg and stimuli indicates entrainment in only a narrow sense (Obleser & Kayser, 2018), that tracking of periodic variation in stimuli is an evoked response to rhythmic stimulus, not an anticipatory phase reseting of intrinsic oscillators.

In addition to looking at tracking of the stimuli by different EEG frequency bands, this study will compare the tracking of different cortical regions. It has been proposed that the bottom-up processing of stimuli is induced by top-down phase reset of sensory areas (Rimmele & Poeppel, 2018; Lakatos et al., 2019). Phase reset is when an external or internal event forces the phase of an oscillating system to align a specific region of its phase with a time point of an internal or external event. There is experimental evidence to support that the entrainment to speech stimuli by auditory areas is controlled higher level frontal and motor areas (Park et al., 2016; ten Oever & Sack, 2015; Giordano et al., 2017). 

Cross correlation will be used as a measure of tracking in this study. A simple cross correlation provides a measure of overall similarity between two time-domain signals. A benefit of cross-correlation over coherence, another common metric for computing similarity between signals, is that coherence solely measures similarity within a frequency band and may require a longer samples to accurately compute to mitigate the effects of temporal smearing. In general, the benefit of a simple cross-correlation over traditional ERP-based analyses is three-fold. Firstly, the cross-correlation is a single trial measure of similarity between EEG and speech signal, meaning that . ERP analysis involve averaging across trials and participants. 





some studies of temporal tracking have indicated that the similarity in temporal properties between eeg and stimuli reflects

That is, the apparently regular pattern of neural activity may arise from an intrinsic oscillator that is not driven by a periodic stimulus or may arise solely as a result of a (pseudo)rhythmic stimulus.

On the other hand, the temporal tracking of periodic variation in stimuli (e.g., Mesgarani/Chang, Hasson, Kraus) has suggested that there is entrainment of neural responses at cortical and subcortical brain regions by stimulus properties.

Phase reset

the phase of an oscillating system is aligned to an external event


phase modulation of an oscil- lating system (brain rhythm) whereby a single event that is external to the oscillating system (for example, sensory input to cortex) forces the oscillating system into a specific phase at the time point of its occurrence



Given this proposed mechanism of stimuli tracking, 

Stimuli tracking by cortical oscillations has been proposed to occur through phase reset (Rimmele & Poeppel, 2018; 


 proposed mechanisms behind the association between the phase of alpha oscillations and stimulus features is that alpha and theta

On the one hand, variation in alpha (Lleras etc), and theta and gamma signals (Large; Poeppel etc) have been considered important temporal signals related to attentional engagement with stimuli. On the other hand, the temporal tracking of periodic variation in stimuli (e.g., Mesgarani/Chang, Hasson, Kraus) has suggested that there is entrainment of neural responses at cortical and subcortical brain regions by stimulus properties.
